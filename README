This contains the self imposed work that I did for Standfords AI class.

The first assignment was to implement the general search algorithm from chapter 3 of the book. It is contained in search/classic.py and search/romania.py. classic.py defines the generic parts for defining a problem and the actual search algorithm in classic.find(). romania.py contains an example of finding a route from Arad to Bucharest. The cost heuristic values are taken directly from the book to my typing percission.
